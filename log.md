# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 04 of 2021, Monday

Today's progress: I added the functionality to the UI, also i change how to invoke them so it's only load when needed instead of been there always hidden.

Thoughts: I really need to refractor the proyect structure and some of the scripts, it's really messy and I'm not following my own structure, it's starting to get hard to find some stuff.

### Day 2: January 03 of 2021, Sunday

Today's progress: I mess arround with UI elements and buttons to create a non functional prototype of a dead screen.

Thoughts: I wasn't really thinking and i was more like trying and error. I have to focus more to be more efficient.

### Day 1: January 02 of 2021, Saturday

Today's progress: I added UI elements to the game to create a "Debugg UI".

Thoughts: Creating UI elements in godot is really easy when you order them correctly, let see if I can do something fancier for the real UI.
