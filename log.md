# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 03 of 2021, Sunday

Today's progress: I mess arround with UI elements and buttons to create a non functional prototype of a dead screen.

Thoughts: I wasn't really thinking and i was more like trying and error. I have to focus more to be more efficient.

### Day 1: January 02 of 2021, Saturday

Today's progress: I added UI elements to the game to create a "Debugg UI".

Thoughts: Creating UI elements in godot is really easy when you order them correctly, let see if I can do something fancier for the real UI.
